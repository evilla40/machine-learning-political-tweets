Homework 3: Supervised machine learning

UIC CS 418, Spring 2020

    Original Instructions:
    
    As in previous homework assignments, activate your python 3.7.4 environment:

    elena-macbook:cs418-hw elena$ source activate cs418env   #omit the source part on windows

    Make sure you are in the directory where you unzipped hw3.zip and start the Jupyter notebook:

    (cs418) elena-macbook:hw3 elena$ jupyter notebook &

    This should open a notebook in your web browser and display the contents of the current directory. Select hw3.ipynb, and follow the instructions in the notebook.
   
  
The goal of this project was to be able to predict the political inclination (Republican/Democrat) of the poster of a tweet.  Machine learning was used to create a binary classifier that labeled each tweet in a test set containing only the text of the tweet.  The classifier was trained with a separate set that contained the ground truth which is the screen name of the user associated with each tweet and the text of the tweet.
